# **App Name**: TaskSP

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Basic login form to authenticate users.
- Task Listing: Task listing for the current day, which will be expanded as the date picker functionality grows
- Task Viewer: Ability to view the description of a single task. If this app had a database, this is the main feature where Stored Procedures would be most obviously and immediately beneficial to manage a layer of indirection.
- SQL generation: File generator. In the file will be all the necessary sql create statements.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Soft, desaturated blue (#D1E2FF) to create a calm and focused atmosphere, nodding to the organizational nature of the app.
- Primary color: Medium blue (#4B8BBE) for key actions and elements. This is more saturated, ensuring contrast and drawing user attention without overwhelming.
- Accent color: A lighter, brighter blue (#77B5FE) to add a touch of vibrancy, without being too overpowering
- Clean and readable sans-serif font.
- Clear, structured layout with distinct sections.
- Simple and consistent icons to represent task status and actions.
- Subtle animations for task transitions.
